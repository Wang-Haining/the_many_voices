People of Yue Forget Not Your Ancestors’ Teachings
Our ancestors had a saying: ‘Kuaiji is a land with the custom of avenging grievances, not a place for harboring dirt and stains.’ This noble spirit, a legacy of King Goujian of Yue, and the unextinguished continuity upheld by gentlemen, persists even today. Despite experiencing ethnic changes in ancient times, the people of Yue have diligently planned and never forgotten their mission of seeking revenge. The entire Shaoxing region has often served as the final resting place for the nobles and commoners of various states. It sounds ominous, but is also truly honorable!
It was the people of Yue who, with painstaking precision, spent many years preparing to launch a counterattack against the northern intruders. Their achievements in life and mourning in death are known throughout the world. Alas, it is the glory of Yue!
However, adversity leads to prosperity. The southeast region has been free from the northern intruders, while internal conflicts frequently arise, leading to divisions. A recent rumor that prefectures in Taizhou and Shaoxing will be independent is not an auspicious sign, even if it is a mere hearsay. People of Yue, how dare you forget the teachings of our ancestors? When you bring prosperity to the nation, the people cannot help but be grateful to you; yet when you inflict harm upon the nation, they cannot help but harbor resentment towards you. You were indeed fortunate to avenge the humiliation of subjugation on behalf of Yue; but now, if you falter and bring about calamity, who then will be there to redress this disgrace for you?
Alas! Will the ancient Yue remain a land with the custom of avenging grievances, or become a place for harboring dirt and stains? The future of the land hangs in the balance. Nonetheless, it is now futile to alter the past, but there is still time to nurture a brighter future.
