Looking at the Land of Yue
It is said that the rise and fall of a nation’s civilization relies on karma as its foundation, and its origins are deeply rooted. To explore the ultimate truth, one must track its ancient ancestors. Karma is rooted in virtue, adhered to customs, depended on faith, and accumulated over a long time. It often spans centuries, and even the most recent developments take several hundred years. When it reaches a state of stability and unity, it reflects the collective will and becomes the embodiment of public sentiment. Even the wisest of sages cannot deny this fact. Therefore, the development of karma does not lie with the highly intelligent but with ordinary people; not with the living but with the deceased. At the same time, the ordinary people with sheer numbers, and the dead with enduring impact, had established their authority. Descendants, inheriting their bloodlines and ideologies, cannot rebel against them in both emotions and actions. Once their karma is passed on through generations, the retribution, whether good or evil, will make a difference. The power of heredity is so awe-inspiring.
The example of ethnicity is the same as any other living beings. The birds of the vast wilderness may have wings but cannot fly; the fish in the dark sea may have eyes but cannot see; and the ordinary people, though possessing intelligence and abilities, often cannot utilize them properly. These inherent traits accumulate and perpetuate as karma, the three cases are similarly so. China suffered under the authoritarian rule of the northern invaders (referring to the Manchu rulers) for over two hundred and sixty years, and has been constrained under the despotic political regime for over 2,130 years. Now, as it gains liberation and moves towards a republic, emerging from the dark valleys to migrate to the towering trees, who among the Chinese would not be delighted? But looking back at the past, there are also elements that evoke fear. The deep-rooted influence accumulated over time is not easy to remove. China’s government and region have always revolved around keeping people ignorant: using punishment to suppress intellectuals and using rewards and positions to attract the cunning and deceitful. The misleading doctrines of Confucianism (specifically referring to Confucianism during the Song dynasty) aided and abetted these tyrannies over the course of two thousand years, leading to the proliferation of morons and the glorification of sycophants, but also to the demise of the truly talented. How terrible is karma; Can the environment improve? The troubles and worries that have plagued generations, indeed have a source.
Now, at this crucial moment of change, I wonder whether the people of China can cleanse their hearts and minds to pursue a new beginning. Or will they continue to seek personal gains and positions? Which path will they choose? Having been born in Yue (an ancient state in China), I am unable to see beyond its boundaries to observe the changes in other regions. So, I can only use the area of Yue as an example to investigate how the gentlemen of Yue build their characters and how ordinary people find their peace. How is the governance of a common servant different from that of a thousand nobles? How does the conduct of a nobleman differ from that of a servant girl? All these similarities and differences should be examined carefully. It reveals the varying qualities of the Chinese people, their intelligence, and their ignorance. If they are good, they bring glory to Yue and blessings to the Xia. If not, the selfish pursuit of personal interests will ultimately harm the whole country. Karma is beyond reproach, but we could be unconventional and abandon the sins of our ancestors. As Confucius said in ‘Gui Shan Cao’ (Gu Qin music made in a mountain shaped like a turtle), ‘I want to see Lu, but Gui Shan obstructs the view. I have no axe handle (to move it); How can I do!’ Now, as I gaze upon the land of Yu (referring to China), it feels as if karma is acting as a barrier, just like Gui Shan. Even if I had an axe handle, would I be able to cut through the natural order and remove it?
