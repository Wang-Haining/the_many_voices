Where will the Republic go?
Under the Manchu regime, tyranny and stereotypes prevailed, laws were crafted arbitrarily, and the government thrived on bribery, leaving the people of Xia without security in their lives and properties. The sins committed are so egregious that they resonate with the heavens, attributed solely to the rule of foreign conquerors. However, the Manchus brought about their own destruction through this tyranny. When the revolution was in the making, racial politics would be carefully scrutinized and contemplated. The revolution has risen, and racial politics are being carefully scrutinized and contemplated. The accumulated filth of yesteryears seems not hard to cleanse, yet when we scrutinize the reality, can we truly believe it? Is it true or not?
Ms. Qiu Jin’s disgrace has been rehabilitated. As a revolutionary pioneer, she once caused widespread indignation because of her arrest and execution without a definitive conviction. However, Zhang Jiemei, with various suspicions, has been detained for a long time, yet without a definite verdict, and there’s a proposal to confiscate his family’s assets. From one perspective, it seems Zhang suffers retribution for sin; but from another, how is it different from replacing one tyranny with another? This is one of the contradictions in the current Republic. Even looking at the overall situation, abuse of power remains, and the suffering of the people continues. For example, the officials parade through the streets with weapons at their side, and enjoy lavish banquets in towering buildings while guards stand watch at the ready. The powerful can enter the court with ease, while the ordinary people might be shackled and beaten. Brutal soldiers also capture innocent people to cause bloodshed. All of these come at countless costs for safety and sustenance. It is clear for people to witness, so what else needs to be attested for the criminals?
Alas! In the past, they were foreign conquerors, and now they are our folks; once they were oppressive rulers, and now they become a part of our republic. However, when comparing the present to the past, where lies the difference between the different periods of our country? If we continue on the same path as we are now, nothing will change from the past. The small regime has boomed in eastern Zhejiang, while differences are perhaps dying out!
